## About

I am a native of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Although also an Italian citizen, My interest in computers started when I was a child, dismantling and repairing every computer I could put my hands on. There I discovered that with enough dedication and perseverance, I could learn anything. Even now I keep studying and improving myself, while at the same time helping new people to fall in love with programming, throughout mentoring, blog posts and meetups. 

Always trying to help the community as Administrator and Mentor in  [RefactorDevs](https://discord.gg/m87nyEGKQA) Or Mentoring in  [ReactLadies](https://www.linkedin.com/company/react-ladies-cba/).
